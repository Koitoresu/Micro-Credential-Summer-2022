        <p>Japan, one of the world’s most literate and technically advanced nations, 
            is an East Asian archipelago country made up of four primary islands and more than 6,800 others. 
            While most of Japan is covered by mountains and heavily wooded areas, the country’s people lead a distinctly urban lifestyle. 
            Long culturally influenced by its neighbors, today the country blends its ancient traditions with aspects of Western life.
        </p>
        <p>The country can trace its political unification to the late fourth and early fifth centuries 
            B.C. Civilization flourished in the late eighth to the late 12th centuries, followed by even more centuries of military rule. 
            The country was isolated from the early 1600s to the mid-19th century, at which point its ports opened up to the West. 
            Japan had grand territorial ambitions in the 1900s, invading several countries, only to be defeated in World War II.

            <p>While many countries around the world have nice hot springs, Japan is the number one destination when it comes to natural springs in the eyes of many. 
                Because of its location in the Ring of Fire, natural onsen are found in every prefecture. 
                Known for their richness in minerals, bathing in the spring water is healing and alleviates many physical ailments such as joint and muscle pain and skin issues.
                 Besides, soaking in a hot spring is very relaxing and refreshing, especially if combined with a ryokan stay. 
                 Another winning combination is doing winter sports like skiing or snowboarding in an onsen resort, as there is nothing quite like 
                 warming up in an outdoor hot spring with the cool air on your face after a day on the slopes.

            <p>The Japanese sport that probably appeals most to the imagination is sumo wrestling. 
                Steeped in tradition, it is indeed interesting to watch the ceremonies surrounding any sumo match and the exciting short bouts of fights. 
                You can either watch the morning practice at a sumo stable, hope to catch them when they are on tour, 
                or go to an actual sumo match during one of the grand tournaments. 
                Whichever way you see the majestic wrestlers in action, we are sure it will be an unforgettable experience!

            <img src="images\photos\jie-N4Y7xJyQE0A-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg" alt="geisha performance">
            <p>When you visit Kyoto, learning more about the geisha tradition, and seeing a maiko performance are all unmissable experiences. 
                There are several ways to see geisha or maiko in action ranging from affordable to expensive. 
                The most budget-friendly way to see maiko perform is to visit Gion Corner, where you can see them perform several traditional arts within 45 minutes. 
                If you are lucky enough to travel to Kyoto in April, you can see the Miyako Odori performed outside for free. 
                But if you want the full experience, you’d have to book a private or group maiko dinner show which is obviously a bit more pricey. 
                It is, however, very much worth it for the special once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
                We recommend those who want to learn more in-depth about geisha and other traditional Japanese culture to book a private guide in Kyoto, 
                who can show all the most interesting highlights and hidden spots of the old capital of Japan.
