                        <p>Anime is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. 
                            Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. However, in Japan and in Japanese, 
                            anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. 
                            Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is commonly referred to as anime-influenced animation.</p>
                        <p>The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. 
                            A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, 
                            developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. 
                            In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. 
                            It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.</p>
                        <p>Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. 
                            It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. 
                            Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, 
                            and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots. 
                            Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.</p>
                        <p>The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios such as Studio Ghibli, 
                            Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, CoMix Wave Films and Toei Animation. Since the 1980s, 
                            the medium has also seen international success with the rise of foreign dubbed, 
                            subtitled programming and its increasing distribution through streaming services. 
                            As of 2016, Japanese animation accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.</p>

            <h2>Which Are Japan's Most Popular Anime?</h2>
            <p>Identifying the best anime or even the most popular anime series is a difficult task. 
                This is because there are anime for young girls (known as shoujo anime), anime for teenage guys (shounen anime), and anime also for adults. <br />
                <br />
                This is the key to the success of the anime industry in Japan. But it also warns against treating anime like a monolithic thing. <br />
                <br />
                However, some anime are easy to point at and identify as extremely popular. 
                Take the films of Studio Ghibli – Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away ­– which each, in turn, was the highest-grossing anime film ever. 
                Kimi No Na Wa is the highest-grossing anime film of all time; however, Spirited Away still remains the only anime movie to have won an Academy Award.</p>

            <h2>Iconic Anime Series</h2>
            <p>Some of the most iconic, if not the best anime series, has changed the way that anime was consumed and appreciated. 
                And these would be recognized by many people across Japan – and the world. <br />
                <br />
                Take Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy, for example, from the sixties, which defined the style of anime that we know today.<br />
                <br />
                Or else, think of Mobile Suit Gundam, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Neon Genesis Evangelion, which changed the direction of anime for the following decade.<br />
                <br />
                These are the classics of the genre. However, they may not exactly be the most popular anime around.</p>

            <h2>The Most Popular Anime?</h2>
            <p>Crudely, we could call the most popular anime those that have sold the most. 
                In this way, Dragon Ball – with its famous central character, Goku – along with One Piece have both sold over three hundred million manga editions.<br />
                <br />
                In terms of anime, the biggest-selling movies are those we discussed by Studio Ghibli – plus Howl's Moving Castle ­– as well as titles 
                including Detective Conan and Pokémon.</p>
