            <p>Originally used to ward off evil spirits, fireworks (花火, Hanabi) have a long history in Japan and are an integral part of Japanese summers. 
                Hundreds of firework shows are held every year across the country, mainly during the summer holidays in July and August, 
                with some of them drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators. On the other hand, fireworks are not typically used to celebrate New Year.<br />
                <br />
                Japanese firework shells range in size from smaller ones to record-breaking Yonshakudama shells which are 1.2 meter in diameter and 
                weigh several hundred kilograms. The most common are starmines, which are spherical shells that have a variety of burst patterns. 
                Other unique fireworks include Niagara sparklers that are set under bridges and resemble the famous falls, 
                and formed shells that burst into familiar shapes such as hearts and smiley faces.</p>
            
            <p>
                A secondary attraction of Japanese fireworks is the relaxed festival atmosphere that comes with them, 
                people dressed in yukata and streets lined by food and game stalls. The firework shows themselves typically start some time after sunset and 
                last one to two hours. Many of the longer shows are broken up into multiple shorter segments, interrupted by the announcement of titles and sponsors. 
                They often end with a grand finale consisting of hundreds of shells launched simultaneously.<br />
                <br />
                Popular firework shows tend to be very crowded which leads to a few concerns for visitors:<br />
                <br/>
                The competition for good viewing spots can be quite strong, and people often show up and reserve the best spots hours in advance, 
                especially in cities where tall buildings limit the number of spots with unobstructed views of the fireworks. 
                Many shows offer paid seating, but tickets are usually not available on the day and are often difficult to get from outside of Japan or 
                without Japanese language skills.</p>
